## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Hey! This is a Kanban board project made by yours truly in order to learn Next.js / React at a deeper level.
The Kanban Board is a challenge from Frontend Mentor. I was given a Figma file and I recreated it from that!
I ended up learning a ton, and tbh the code isn't as pretty as I would like, but I'll be sure to improve this in
the future (:
